# Welcome to the seanpm2001 Marine Biology data repository

This folder is for research documents and media related to marine biology and aquatic life.

I have currently had 3 eras of high level animal care, and 1 lower level

## The lower level (March 21st 2001-2011)

I have had pets all my life, and have enjoyed their comfort and company. Early on, my family had a few dogs, and we raised chickens from time to time.

I didn't get fish until 2011.

## The pet shop era (2011-2015)

In 2011, I got my first fish. This is what started a valued piece of my childhood known as the Pet Shop era.

Between 2011 and 2015, I worked on creating a pet store called `PetLand` (the name may have already been taken, and I never sold any of my fish, as I cared for them too much to rid of them.) I constantly tinkered with various fishtanks and various fish, and had a lot of good times. I also took some notes, and made some friends.

Later on, I got a set of geckos. These were the first non-aquatic addition to the pet shop. Unfortunately, my pet shop era ended in 2015, as I began to lose interest, and I donated my Geckos to my middle school homeroom teacher. I continued to have fish in a fishtank.

Despite the empty era, my family got chickens and horses as well. These were taken care of daily (and we still have most of them, but most of the chickens have been replaced)

## The dry era (2015-March 22nd 2021)

**Originally called:** `Empty Era`. _Dry seems more fitting, as there were less aquatic creatures, so my marine biology was a bit more dry._

Between 2015 and 2021, I still had my fish, and took care of them. They had a pretty good life and they were well cared for, living in a 29 gallon tank, and getting treats. Over time, more and more fish died of cancer and old age, and eventually only 3 fish were left; a Koi I had since 5th grade, and 2 cleaner fish.

On March 15th 2021, my Koi died due to a fishtank cleaning incident. The cause of death was unknown, although it can be narrowed down to 2 causes: old age or shock. It was a very hard day for me. This fish was the oldest fish I had, and was a very social one. He loved the attention of the family when we went to see him, and we fed him pretzels daily, as he liked eating them (we also gave him normal fish food as well) there were some things I wanted to do before he died, but I never got to them.

On March 22nd 2021, my dad bought over a dozen new fish, and a new fishtank. The next day, a huge upgrade to this change was done, which brought me into my second marine biology phase.

## The Marine Biology age II (March 23rd 2021-present)

After our aquatic life household surpassed 40 residents, I decided to get back into marine biology part-time.

I started getting daily videos of my fish on March 23rd 2021, as my family recently got an abundance of aquatic life, and it inspired me to get back into Marine Biology part-time.

I am now doing research on aquatic life again, and working on finding my older notes.
