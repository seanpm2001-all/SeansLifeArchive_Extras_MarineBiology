# Notice

This folder is for personal videos of my marine biology work, study, and reference. Currently, the videos are too high quality and too large to be uploaded here on GitHub, due to GitHubs 25 megabyte per file limit.

I started getting daily videos of my fish on March 23rd 2021, as my family recently got an abundance of aquatic life, and it inspired me to get back into Marine Biology part-time.
