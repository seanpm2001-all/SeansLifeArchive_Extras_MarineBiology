# Video for today:

I got a late night video today showing off the default mode of the tanks lighting with the lights in place (as the new lid came today) I will try to get different angles of the lighting for the next week or so, there are a lot of combinations with the blue and white light settings.

## Availability online

Videos are not yet available on GitHub, as todays video (NOT YET CALCULATED MiB/NOT YET CALCULATED MB) significantly exceeds GitHubs upload limit (25 MiB/26.214 MB)
