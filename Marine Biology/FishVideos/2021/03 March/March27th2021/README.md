# Video for today:

I got a shorter video today. Today was also a non-interrupted video day as well. I have learned to do the video when no-one is home.

The fish had already been fed earlier today, todays video was just to showcase daily progress in growth, stock video, and to show off the maximum extent of decorations for this time (decorations will be swapped every once in a while, this is as many decorations as there can be in the tank)

Todays video was 30 seconds instead of 60 seconds (1 minute)
