# Video for today:

I got a shorter video today. Today was also a non-interrupted video day as well. I have learned to do the video when no-one is home.

I did the video late at night, after GitHub work, so I might need to come back and add the actual size amounts. We got a really cool blue light that made the fishtank look even better, like a masterpiece, but the bubble decorations and other aspects were causing too much splashing and got the light too wet, so it was removed. We are going to get a cover for it.

I really wanted to get a video with the light on tonight, but it wasn't possible tonight, and may not be possible tomorrow. It might take a few days or weeks of waiting (although it likely won't take weeks)

## Availability online

Videos are not yet available on GitHub, as todays video (NOT RECORDED MiB/NOT RECORDED MB) significantly exceeds GitHubs upload limit (25 MiB/26.214 MB)
